                            <p>Everyday we eat food in order to give our bodies energy to play, work, and <br> do the things we need to do. There are lots of words to describe where our food <br> comes from, what our food tastes like.</p>

                                <h3>Seared Ahi Tuna & Arugula</h3>
                                <p>If it wasn't already obvious, the most important part of this recipe is the fish. Make sure you're getting quality sushi-grade Ahi Tunaâ€”it tastes MUCH better raw than your average grocery store cut of tuna.</p>

                                <p>In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil until hot. Add tuna steaks to the pan and sear 30 seconds to 1 minute per side, depending on desired doneness. Transfer to a cutting board.</p>

                                <p>Season tuna steaks all over with salt and pepper. Combine black and white sesame seeds on a shallow plate, then gently press tuna steaks into seeds to coat them on all sides.</p>
